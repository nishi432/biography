		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			I love to paint. It is my hobby. I paint with water colours. I like to paint beautiful landscapes. When we go on holidays to different places like hill stations, desert areas, river banks or the countryside, I always take my art material with me. I like to sit and paint a scenery as I watch it. The painting then is very vivid and comes alive. I find my hobby refreshing to me. I keep all my paintings carefully. I have participated in different art exhibitions and painting competitions at school and at state level events, and won prizes too.
